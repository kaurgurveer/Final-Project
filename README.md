# Portfolio
How to run Project:  
Download the zip file and open it. Open the index.html file with a browser and then you will be able to see the website.

Overview:  
The purpose of a portfolio is to showcase work to potential employers. I started this project from scratch rather than building upon my portfolio from assignment 1 because what I had envisioned was completely different from before. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement the features.

Responsive:  
In order to ensure the website was responsive, I added media query breakpoints to account for smaller phone screens, tablets, and large phones.

Accessibility:  
In order to ensure the webpages pass accessibility guidelines, I had my pages validated by AChecker. I have provided screen shots of the results. 

Requirements:  
1.	I have multiple pages with appropriate navigation between them. From the Home page and the portfolio page you can access 3 other pages.
2.	Navigation bar with 3 links and once in mobile view it changes to an animated hamburger menu. When you click the hamburger menu there is a circle animation and it will display the 3 links.
3.	I have a grid layout in the home page and the portfolio page even though it was only required on one page. The purpose of also adding it to the home page was to have a useful inital view. The cards have images, titles, descriptions, and hover animations. For the hover animations I have the link appear and the text disappear once you hover over the card to take you to another page. Another hover animation I added in the grid is the color changes when you hover over the link to indicate it is clickable.
4.	Animations:  
a.	Typography animation was implemented in the about page.   
b.	Loading animation was implemented in the home page because that takes a long time to load so the animation actually shows up. I also decided to implement this animation in the visualization page because that also took some time to load, but not as long so you only see a flash of the animation.    
c.	Scrolling animation was implemented on the Portfolio page. It alternates so the cards comes from right then left as you scroll down the page.  
d.	Hover animations was implemented on all the pages because it takes place in the nav bar. When you hover over the links in the nav bar the color changes to a light grey to indicate it is clickable.  
5.	I edited text and background color to make sure website is visually nice.
6.	I edited background picture to make sure website is visually nice and readable.
7.	I edited padding and margins to make website readable. 
8.	Vega-Lite: I got covid-19 data from a third party API and embedded the data in bar graphs using Vega-Lite. I displayed the number of confirmed, recovered, active, and death cases in each country in the visualization page. The bar graph is long due to the large number of countries recorded so u have to scroll through the page.

Other:  
I added a favicon.   
I added a particle animation in the background in the about page.
